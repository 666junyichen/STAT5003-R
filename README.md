# Predicting Hospital Readmissions: A Data-Driven Approach to Diabetes Readmissions

This repository contains my data science project for the course STAT5003-R at the University of Sydney. The project includes R code for data analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a final report. The project was executed using Quarto and R.

## Description

In this project, I perform a comprehensive analysis of a healthcare dataset focused on diabetes patient readmissions. The project aims to predict whether a diabetic patient will return to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. Using this dataset, I apply exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and data visualizations to uncover insights and patterns that can predict readmission risks.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts hospital readmissions based on various factors such as patient demographics, medical history, and hospital data. The project aims to improve healthcare decision-making by identifying high-risk patients and enhancing hospital care quality through predictive insights.

This project is implemented using R and Quarto, with the final report being generated as an HTML document. It includes visualizations, statistical analysis, and evaluation of different machine learning models.
