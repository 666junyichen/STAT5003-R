# STAT5003-R - Data Science Project

This repository contains my data science project for the course STAT5003-R at the University of Sydney. The project includes R code for data analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a final report. The project was executed using Quarto and R.

## Description

In this project, I perform a comprehensive analysis of a dataset related to [e.g., diabetes, healthcare, economic data, etc.]. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and data visualizations aimed at understanding key patterns and insights within the dataset.

The goal of this project is to explore the relationships between various factors, such as [e.g., age, BMI, physical activity], and identify potential predictors of [e.g., diabetes risk, health outcomes, economic growth]. Additionally, I aim to demonstrate how these insights can inform decision-making and further research in [e.g., healthcare, policy, economics].

This project is implemented using R and Quarto, with the final report being generated as an HTML document, which includes visualizations, statistical analysis, and model evaluations.
