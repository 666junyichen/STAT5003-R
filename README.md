# STAT5003-R

## Project Overview

This repository contains my coursework and projects for STAT5003 - Statistical Inference and Data Analysis using R. The project focuses on applying statistical methods and R programming to analyze real-world datasets.

## About

STAT5003 is a graduate-level statistics course that covers fundamental concepts in statistical inference, hypothesis testing, and data analysis. This project demonstrates the application of these concepts through practical R implementations.

## Project Structure

```
STAT5003-R/
├── README.md          # This file - project documentation
└── data/             # Datasets used in the analysis (to be added)
└── scripts/          # R scripts for analysis (to be added)
└── reports/          # Analysis reports and visualizations (to be added)
```

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need:

- **R** (version 4.0 or higher)
- **RStudio** (recommended IDE)
- Required R packages:
  - `tidyverse` - for data manipulation and visualization
  - `ggplot2` - for creating graphics
  - `dplyr` - for data manipulation
  - Additional packages as specified in individual scripts

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/666junyichen/STAT5003-R.git
   cd STAT5003-R
   ```

2. Install required R packages:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))
   ```

## Usage

Instructions for running specific analyses will be added as the project develops. Each script will include comments explaining the analysis steps and methodology.

## Topics Covered

- Statistical Inference
- Hypothesis Testing
- Regression Analysis
- Data Visualization
